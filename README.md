# ![steamserver](logo.png)
A server to the Steam 2003 client written in Python.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is being made to have Steam's client from 2003 fit in with modern times, if you wish to use other Steam versions, check out <p><a href="https://github.com/real-pmein1/stmsrvemu" />The StmSrvEmu repository instead!</p>

# Features (Planned)
- Steam account compatibility: You can log into your Steam account to chat with your friends!
- Custom game addition: You can add your own Steam games (That are not in the original launch titles) to the game list!
- Custom client themes: With this program, you can change the way your client works!
- Offline mode: Create a Steam account on your server to use the client offline! (It is best recommended to use your existing Steam account for all of the features.)
